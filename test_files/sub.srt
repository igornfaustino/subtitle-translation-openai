00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:34,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">According to the Division of Astronomy, the spectrum of the detected star contained characteristics of a Moratorium.</font>

00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,817

5
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:45,487
<font face="Constantia" size="53">This isn't good.</font>

6
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:51,487
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What's going on?</font>

7
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:55,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why Tahara's daughter?</font>

8
00:00:57,227 --> 00:01:00,167
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Do you have any particular information on her?</font>

9
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:11,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">When I was a child, Papa told me there was an amulet inside that was protecting me.</font>

10
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:25,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Information about Tahara's daughter being a contractor or something didn't exist until today.</font>

11
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Do you know what this means?</font>

12
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:33,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Tahara's research was progressing according to his plans.</font>

<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's not my fault!</font>

36
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,407
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Meyer & Hilton?</font>

37
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:25,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">When the U.K. started mobilizing during the Argentine Coast War,</font>

38
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:29,417
<font face="Constantia" size="53">they supplied the country with contractors for artillery purposes, since they were the first company to implement such weaponry.</font>

39
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,217
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I haven't heard any good rumors about them.</font>

40
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:35,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Inbreeding in order to mass-produce contractors...</font>

00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:47,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What is their relationship with the Moratorium in question?</font>

44
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,417
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Unknown.</font>

45
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, around ten years ago,</font>

46
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">a Japanese man was hired as a researcher.</font>

47
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,317
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There has been no leakage of details.</font>

48
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,637
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Their purpose of entry, the subject of the research,</font>

49
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,677
<font face="Constantia" size="53">and the emergence of the new star...</font>

50
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:06,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There may be some correlation between them.</font>

51
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:11,237
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Understood. I'll have Saitou and Kouno look into it.</font>

52
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm on the trail of the Moratorium.</font>

53
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hurry, Kirihara.</font>

54
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The Moratorium must be apprehended and quarantined at once.</font>

55
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">They are neither contractors nor Dolls.</font>

56
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:27,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Rather, they're defective monsters who merely abuse their powers and have no sense of self-awareness.</font>

57
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'll do my best.</font>

59
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:53,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Boss!</font>

60
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Good work, Inspector.</font>

61
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">How's the target, Chief Ishizaki?</font>

62
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:05,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Our mediums have tracked it again around Nerima Ward.</font>

63
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:10,017
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, we have only confirmed the tail end of a strong, sentient resonance.</font>

64
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:13,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">We have suspended further monitoring activities for the time being.</font>

65
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:17,917
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What about the evacuation alert?</font>

66
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:21,607
<font face="Constantia" size="53">We have already issued one for a five kilometer radius under the pretense of a broken gas line.</font>

67
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It has been a while, Hoshimi-sama.</font>

68
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:39,757
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's me, Kirihara.</font>

69
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:53,597
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The reason why contractors are called contractors in the first place</font>

70
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:58,207
<font face="Constantia" size="53">is because they have to go through a mentally exhausting, yet necessary procedure,</font>

71
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:01,017
<font face="Constantia" size="53">referred to as remuneration, after using their acquired abilities.</font>

72
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:04,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The process of remuneration is deferred for the Moratorium.</font>

73
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:09,487
<font face="Constantia" size="53">After a period of time, most of them alter their states into that of a Doll,</font>

74
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,607
<font face="Constantia" size="53">much like our mediums.</font>

75
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:19,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Unlike standard contractors, the Moratorium cannot control their abilities.</font>

76
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:22,957
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's what we're dealing with.</font>

77
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:29,147
<font face="Constantia" size="53">To be honest, the Observatory doesn't know any more than what the people from External Affairs do.</font>

78
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:32,137
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Moratorium sightings are few and far between.</font>

79
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I see.</font>

80
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:39,147
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Its pulse seems a little unstable this time.</font>

81
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:42,367
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Long story short, there's no telling what it'll do.</font>

82
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:49,897
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There you go again, raising your brow!</font>

83
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:54,737
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're not young anymore, so be careful or those wrinkles will become permanent.</font>

84
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:58,327
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're as old as I am. You're not in a position to say that to me, Kanami.</font>

85
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:03,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't worry about me. I don't take life seriously enough to develop wrinkles.</font>

86
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:08,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You haven't changed at all.</font>

87
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Neither have you.</font>

88
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,557

<font face="Constantia" size="53">I was the sole survivor of the First Gate Reconnaissance Troop.</font>

135
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:59,247
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I had brought a certain material back with me at the time.</font>

136
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:05,627
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There was a possibility I could block the activation of a contractor's abilities by implanting it inside their bodies.</font>

137
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:12,917
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I discovered it two years after being employed by Meyer & Hilton.</font>

138
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:16,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Around the same time...</font>

139
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,197
<font face="Constantia" size="53">M-Mai!</font>

140
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,167
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Stop that!</font>

141
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:37,807
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why?</font>

142
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:44,927
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The way contractors were regarded by the public...</font>

143
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You know what I'm talking about, don't you?</font>

144
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:58,697
<font face="Constantia" size="53">By implanting the unknown material found within the gate into Mai's wrist...</font>

145
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:02,187
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I attempted to prevent the activation of her abilities.</font>

146
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,237
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I was grasping at straws.</font>

147
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:11,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, straws isn't correct. What I was grasping at were seeds.</font>

148
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:16,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">In retrospect, those seeds may have contained the curse of the gate.</font>

149
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It might have been punishment for treading inside.</font>

150
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:24,167
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The seed implanted in Mai will eventually deteriorate.</font>

151
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,637
<font face="Constantia" size="53">After that happens, her ability will be awakened.</font>

152
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">As I continued my research,</font>

153
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:35,847
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I came to the conclusion that complete suppression would be impossible.</font>

154
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:41,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Furthermore, the host body of the implanted seed would transform into a Moratorium.</font>

155
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,977
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There's no telling when its curse will subside.</font>

156
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:53,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">With my own hands, I turned my daughter into a monster that can't even become a contractor.</font>

157
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I destroyed whatever data remained.</font>

158
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,957
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I erased Mai's memories using the M.E. and left the company.</font>

159
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:06,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I couldn't afford to let them find out about it.</font>

160
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:09,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I didn't want her to become the subject of an actual experiment.</font>

161
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:13,927
<font face="Constantia" size="53">So you abandoned everything you had and ran off to this town.</font>

162
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:20,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Didn't I just say it's impossible to suppress the activation of the contract?</font>

163
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:24,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Are you saying I should continue this meaningless experiment on my child?</font>

164
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:31,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I was able to bring back two seeds.</font>

165
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">One is in Mai's wrist.</font>

166
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The other...</font>

167
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:40,657
<font face="Constantia" size="53">If the seed within Mai began to deteriorate to the point of vanishing entirely...</font>

168
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:44,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">If I could cultivate the seed and implant it again,</font>

169
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:51,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'd be able to suppress the Moratorium's instinctual behavior forever.</font>

170
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:58,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The only time I had peace of mind was when I watered this pot.</font>

171
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,847
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, time stopped this morning.</font>

172
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It didn't bear any seeds.</font>

173
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,227
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I was frightened...</font>

174
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:13,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Frightened of witnessing the result of my sins.</font>

175
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:18,907
<font face="Constantia" size="53">If I knew this was going to happen, she would have been better off as a contractor!</font>

176
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,697
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're confessing your sins to the wrong person.</font>

177
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:27,007
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You deserve to be confined inside this room forever.</font>

178
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,437
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It was supposed to bear lots of fruit.</font>

179
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,087
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai...</font>

180
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:46,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Lots and lots of seeds for your amulet were supposed to come out.</font>

181
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:59,287
<font face="Constantia" size="53">And the eyebrow is bushy with spots of whiskers...</font>

182
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:02,977
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Finally here?</font>

183
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yeah, some dog wandered in.</font>

184
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:16,627
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That idiot!</font>

185
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:23,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Koutou Ward, Shinonome warehouse district.</font>

186
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:42,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">A contractor?</font>

187
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,777
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It looks like you and I are alike.</font>

188
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:05,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's as far as you go!</font>

189
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:12,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Or do you not care about what happens to Tahara's daughter?</font>

190
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:18,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You should have retrieved the daughter instead of going after me.</font>

191
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:23,517
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Really, you hired a strange contractor...</font>

192
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Dr. Tahara.</font>

193
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,237
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Return my daughter.</font>

194
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">In that case, are you willing to lend us a hand?</font>

195
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:38,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I will not return to your company.</font>

196
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,537
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I brought referential material from my research instead.</font>

197
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:44,757
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hand it over.</font>

198
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,467
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My daughter comes first.</font>

199
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:52,217
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hey, your beloved papa has come to pick you up, Mai-chan.</font>

200
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, I don't know... that person.</font>

201
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:03,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No!</font>

202
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,027
<font face="Constantia" size="53">H-Hurry up and hand over the documents!</font>

203
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,017
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What the hell is this?</font>

204
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,537
<font face="Constantia" size="53">References.</font>

205
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What are you trying to pull?</font>

206
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,977
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hand over the real thing!</font>

207
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">This is all that's left of my research.</font>

208
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,927
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No! No! Let go!</font>

209
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:37,577
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, Mai's papa is more handsome!</font>

210
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,267
<font face="Constantia" size="53">He's stronger!</font>

211
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,477
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, your father is a horrible person.</font>

212
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:45,097
<font face="Constantia" size="53">He's not horrible! He tells me many, many stories!</font>

213
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">He protects Mai!</font>

214
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:50,497
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai likes Papa very much!</font>

215
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:56,597
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Papa likes you very much, too.</font>

216
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,297
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I love you...</font>

217
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,167
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai.</font>

218
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:15,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Forget about him! Get a hold of the sample!</font>

219
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:30,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Smiles don't belong on people like you.</font>

220
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:37,877
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai...</font>

221
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:39,407
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai...</font>

222
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:44,227
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My work... is finally done.</font>

223
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,057
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Mai...</font>

224
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:49,957
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm home.</font>

225
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Welcome back...</font>

226
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:55,847
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Papa.</font>

227
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:06,067
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wait... It was Ruuko who did it, not me!</font>

228
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Stop, Mai.</font>

229
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,187
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why?</font>

230
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:15,817
<font face="Constantia" size="53">D-Don't...</font>

231
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Her remuneration.</font>

232
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,817
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Did she become a contractor?</font>

233
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">A Moratorium?</font>

234
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The probability is practically zero...</font>

235
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:54,317
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Geez, strange things sure do happen.</font>

236
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'll forget about what happened to Tahara.</font>

237
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,777
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I have something much more interesting instead.</font>

238
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:09,287
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I feel as if I've killed many people.</font>

239
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,607
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't be so depressed.</font>

240
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Contractors exist solely to kill people.</font>

241
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:17,597
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I guess you're not depressed at all.</font>

242
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,757
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Where am I going?</font>

243
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:26,427
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Heaven, although it'll be a long journey by ship.</font>

244
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:37,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">When we arrived at the scene, the Moratorium's location</font>

245
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:41,867
<font face="Constantia" size="53">and Messier code BK201, which was flickering along with it,</font>

246
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,377
<font face="Constantia" size="53">could not be traced.</font>

247
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:50,697
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Eventually, investigation of Case Code 1032 was transferred away from the Department of Intelligence.</font>

248
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:55,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">To this day, no information of any significance has surfaced.</font>

249
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:59,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, one thing's for certain.</font>

250
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:07,137
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The star that appeared that day has yet to fall.</font>
