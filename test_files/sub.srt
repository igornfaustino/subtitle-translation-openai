00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:12,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Misaki, you really like greasy food, don't you?</font>

2
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:15,157
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Well, I'm hungry.</font>

3
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:16,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You don't get fat, either.</font>

4
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:20,247
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's because I move around every day.</font>

5
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:23,417
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Kanami, what are you filling out?</font>

6
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Oh, the career survey.</font>

7
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,907
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What a hassle. We're still in our first year, you know.</font>

8
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,067
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's not like we're thinking about our careers yet.</font>

9
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,317
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What are you going to be?</font>

10
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:38,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I don't know anything about my future 
 so I might look into a college education,</font>

11
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:43,817
<font face="Constantia" size="53">unlike someone who's already set her academic and vocational goals.</font>

12
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:49,067
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Did you know she already decided to join the police right after she graduates from Tokyo University?</font>

13
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Police?</font>

14
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:51,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Kanami!</font>

15
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You really have a father complex.</font>

16
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:55,007
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's not true.</font>

17
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,257
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Is that so?</font>

18
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:03,707
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My father might have suggested it, 
 but I have my own reasons.</font>

19
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,377
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Like what?</font>

20
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:14,887
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There are a lot of people in this world who seek to gain at the expense of other people's misery.</font>

21
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,197
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's something I can't tolerate.</font>

22
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,467
<font face="Constantia" size="53">So you want to defend the weak, huh?</font>

23
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:25,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're still the same old goody two-shoes, Misaki.</font>

24
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:28,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hey, is that any way to treat me for telling you about it?</font>

25
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's mine!</font>

26
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hey, give it back!</font>

27
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Too late now!</font>

28
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:34,757
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You eat too much!</font>

29
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Delicious! Give me another one!</font>

30
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:36,217
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No!</font>

31
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why not?</font>

32
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,827
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Now I've lost it</font>

33
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,167
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}I know I can kill</font>

34
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:44,077
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}The truth exists beyond the Gate</font>

35
00:01:55,227 --> 00:02:01,007
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Tears stream from closed eyelids</font>

36
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:06,567
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Fragments of reason and blood continually eaten away</font>

37
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,697
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}I don't want anything anymore</font>

38
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,447
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}(Emotions laid bare, around, turn around)</font>

39
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,577
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}I don't feel the way as before</font>

40
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:17,497
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}(Gang bang son of a gun)</font>

41
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:22,967
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Caught in between two hearts</font>

42
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:30,547
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}My body, parched for all it wants</font>

43
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:36,637
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Pouring into the night on tainted fingertips,</font>

44
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:41,827
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}prying you open until torn apart</font>

45
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:47,977
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Love grates as it peels away in shallow sleep</font>

46
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:53,867
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}If I only could wipe everything there is out now...</font>

47
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,077
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Sun will rise</font>

48
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:57,647
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Close your eyes</font>

49
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,437
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Downfallen (fallen) falling</font>

50
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,957
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Hold inside</font>

51
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:05,417
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="50">{\an1}Just howling in the shadows</font>

52
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:12,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Today is such a wonderful day.</font>

53
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't you think so, Misaki?</font>

54
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:21,617
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't hide. Come out and celebrate with me.</font>

55
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What are you doing in a place like this?</font>

56
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:34,567
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Well, I was told to bring drinks to the owner,</font>

57
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:36,697
<font face="Constantia" size="53">but when I arrived...</font>

58
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">At this rate, we'll be killed as well.</font>

59
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,437
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Try to do something.</font>

60
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,947
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Easier said than done.</font>

61
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:53,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Even after I started using the bees, there was one thing that wouldn't disappear from this world.</font>

62
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:57,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That will come to an end tonight, though.</font>

63
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Everything that held me down...</font>

64
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,467
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My father,</font>

65
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Chen Long Tang...</font>

66
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,307
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Everything...</font>

67
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:39,487
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wei...</font>

68
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,497
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You bastard...</font>

69
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,787
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wei has been assisting me.</font>

70
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">He's a confidant of mine.</font>

71
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:02,207
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Besides, today is a good day.</font>

72
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:09,367
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It must have been fate for us to have been reunited today.</font>

73
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,577
<font face="Constantia" size="53">When I give you the signal, run.</font>

74
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:21,177
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Misaki, that's why you should die for my sake and set me free.</font>

75
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,227
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm talking to you, Misaki.</font>

76
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:25,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Now!</font>

77
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:37,217
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I won't let you escape, Misaki.</font>

78
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:45,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Who are you exactly?</font>

79
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:47,607
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm from the police.</font>

80
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:50,617
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Aren't you a friend of the debutante?</font>

81
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What are we going to do now?</font>

82
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:59,637
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'd like to get out of the building, for one.</font>

83
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:13,357
<font face="Kozuka Mincho Pro B" size="65" color="#e4e3e6"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="25"><font color="#3c393d">Closed for 
periodic inspection</font></font></font></b></font>

84
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,357
<font face="Constantia" size="53">We are very sorry.</font>

85
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:19,437
<font face="Constantia" size="53">We are currently in the process of 
 identifying the problem. Please be patient.</font>

86
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:23,517
<font face="Constantia" size="53">They're not allowing anyone to go downstairs.</font>

87
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">How about the emergency stairwell?</font>

88
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,377
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's definitely been closed off.</font>

89
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,237
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You cannot allow anyone to leave.</font>

90
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:32,877
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Is that clear?</font>

91
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:42,197
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yes?</font>

92
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,477
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yes, I understand.</font>

93
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,747
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The board meeting is over.</font>

94
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,427
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Clean up the room.</font>

95
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,217
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Sir.</font>

96
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:10,737
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Um... What are we going to do now?</font>

97
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm thinking about that right now!</font>

98
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:13,897
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Okay...</font>

99
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Do you have a cell phone?</font>

100
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:20,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, carrying one around during work is against the rules.</font>

101
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:22,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm sorry.</font>

102
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:26,637
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's a blackout,</font>

103
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">but there's no need to worry.</font>

104
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:31,727
<font face="Constantia" size="53">This hotel is equipped with a proprietary power generator.</font>

105
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:34,477
<font face="Constantia" size="53">See?</font>

106
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:38,427
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Did they cut the power from the lines to 
 prevent observer apparitions from entering?</font>

107
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Observer apparitions?</font>

108
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,507
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's nothing!</font>

109
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why is this happening?</font>

110
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:46,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Who knows?</font>

111
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:50,127
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why would Alice want to kill me?</font>

112
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,517
<font face="Constantia" size="53">She's my friend... Why?</font>

113
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You were betrayed,</font>

114
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,477
<font face="Constantia" size="53">poor thing.</font>

115
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,377
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What would you know about this feeling?</font>

116
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm sorry.</font>

117
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm the one who should be apologizing.</font>

118
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:15,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Being betrayed by a friend is probably a terrible experience.</font>

119
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:24,947
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why are we talking about these things in a place like this?</font>

120
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're right.</font>

121
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're a strange one.</font>

122
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,477
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's what everyone always says about me.</font>

123
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:38,597
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I wonder why.</font>

124
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:44,567
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That aside, you don't have to hide here since you haven't been seen.</font>

125
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,907
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Didn't you realize that?</font>

126
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,307
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wait a minute... In that case,</font>

127
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:54,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">can you go to the hall and bring Saitou here?</font>

128
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,817
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Once you do that, you can run 
 away or do whatever you want.</font>

129
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,187
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Please.</font>

130
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,317
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Okay.</font>

131
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My name is Li Shun Sheng.</font>

132
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,817
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I don't think I've introduced myself.</font>

133
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,327
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm Kirihara Misaki.</font>

134
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:18,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's the first time I've introduced myself inside a toilet stall.</font>

135
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:19,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Me, too.</font>

136
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:24,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Misaki is inside the hotel?</font>

137
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:26,487
<font face="Constantia" size="53">How can that be?</font>

138
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,807
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's the building that had its power cut off, so we can't use observer apparitions.</font>

139
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,347
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The usage of his powers has been detected.</font>

140
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,537
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It's obvious that VI952 is inside!</font>

141
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,357
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why would she be at a place like that?</font>

142
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,127
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I already know that!</font>

143
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,357
<font face="Constantia" size="53">She can't be reached by phone, and there's no doubt something's going on there.</font>

144
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:48,057
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There aren't any signs of a distress signal, 
 and we can't conduct a search without a warrant.</font>

145
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:50,187
<font face="Constantia" size="53">In that case, have them issue a warrant immediately!</font>

146
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,877
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What in the world are you doing, boss?</font>

147
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,417
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't ask. Shut the door now!</font>

148
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Y-Yes...</font>

149
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:13,047
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wei, please capture Misaki for me.</font>

150
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:16,287
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Otherwise, I can't be free.</font>

151
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:21,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yes, it is just one woman. I shall bring her to you shortly.</font>

152
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:24,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, you're wrong.</font>

153
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Misaki isn't alone.</font>

154
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">She was with a man.</font>

155
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:30,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">A man?</font>

156
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,617
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="46" color="#d6d7da">{\an1}Episode Ten</font>

157
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,617
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="46" color="#d6d7da">{\an1}The White Dress, Stained with the Girl's Dreams and Blood... </font>

158
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,617
<font face="DFPLeiSho-SB" size="46" color="#d6d7da">{\an1}(Part Two)</font>

159
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:47,747
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Saitou, isn't there a better way?</font>

160
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,557
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You want to go outside unnoticed, don't you?</font>

161
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:55,007
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The best way to escape is to go down to the laundry room.</font>

162
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:59,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">More importantly, what happened?</font>

163
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Everyone seems so uptight.</font>

164
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:03,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'll explain later.</font>

165
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,677
<font face="Constantia" size="53">By the way, Li-kun,</font>

166
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:07,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">what's this all ab...</font>

167
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,437
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What's wrong?</font>

168
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:14,267
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No, it's nothing.</font>

169
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:50,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You came, as expected.</font>

170
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:55,857
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Did you think you could use that officer as a decoy?</font>

171
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,577
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Very imprudent of you.</font>

172
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:02,737
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I don't know which organization you're from, but you're no match for me.</font>

173
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,827
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I will make sure you return it to me.</font>

174
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:10,957
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Oh, this?</font>

175
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:16,967
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Shedding blood is my remuneration as a contractor.</font>

176
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,337
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Shall we begin?</font>

177
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,937
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What's wrong?</font>

178
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The show has just begun.</font>

179
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:31,247
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I've heard a rumor about the existence of a proficient contractor who manipulates electricity at will.</font>

180
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,247
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I see. You're that BK201.</font>

181
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:41,407
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You intentionally lured me toward you so that I'd drop my guard.</font>

182
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,257
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, it seems that you've made a critical mistake at the last moment.</font>

183
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,507
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Apparently, I'm faster than you are.</font>

184
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,657
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Saitou, this way.</font>

185
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,117
<font face="Constantia" size="53">But...</font>

186
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,267
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't panic. Act as you normally do.</font>

187
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Okay.</font>

188
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,807
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're in charge of this room.</font>

189
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:25,627
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Okay.</font>

190
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:33,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There aren't any tables.</font>

191
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,907
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That was close. I almost had you.</font>

192
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,927
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Alice! What are you doing?</font>

193
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Didn't I tell you?</font>

194
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,167
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Today will be the end of everything that has been holding me down.</font>

195
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:07,137
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Kinship was what Chen Long Tang revered more than anything else.</font>

196
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:14,587
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's why, as the successor by lineage, 
 regardless of whether I wanted to or not...</font>

197
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:19,307
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I had to live a life shouldering the burden of Chen Long Tang.</font>

198
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:27,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Even when the gate appeared and the 
 world was in turmoil, nothing changed.</font>

199
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:31,987
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, Wang Shao Tang is dead,</font>

200
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:34,807
<font face="Constantia" size="53">and Chen Long Tang has disappeared without a trace.</font>

201
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,737
<font face="Constantia" size="53">All thanks to Wei Zhi Jun.</font>

202
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,177
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Boss, who is he?</font>

203
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,407
<font face="Constantia" size="53">VI952.</font>

204
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,297
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Saitou...</font>

205
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:52,537
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Please, Wei, set me free.</font>

206
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,297
<font face="Constantia" size="53">With this, you are now free.</font>

207
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:14,657
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Alice!</font>

208
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,367
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why?</font>

209
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:22,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You didn't want freedom.</font>

210
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,927
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You only sought to be bound, 
 always relying on someone else, Alice.</font>

211
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,037
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No...</font>

212
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:35,807
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Sometimes it was Kirihara Misaki, and sometimes it was me.</font>

213
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,547
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You didn't want to be freed from your father,</font>

214
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:43,087
<font face="Constantia" size="53">but rather bound to him, didn't you?</font>

215
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:51,707
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Alice!</font>

216
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,387
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Alice! Alice!</font>

217
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,727
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're a heartless person.</font>

218
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:07,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Haven't you realized you were the one who liberated Alice from her dependency on her father?</font>

219
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:08,957
<font face="Constantia" size="53">What did you say?</font>

220
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:17,257
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It was the first time someone questioned her father's authority.</font>

221
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,687
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Your father has nothing to do with this!</font>

222
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:26,767
<font face="Constantia" size="53">That's when she found another person to rely on.</font>

223
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:30,317
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, you became a police officer,</font>

224
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:37,327
<font face="Constantia" size="53">a person deemed unacceptable in the world of Wang Shao Tan's daughter.</font>

225
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:38,877
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It can't be...</font>

226
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,207
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Boss!</font>

227
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,677
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Saitou!</font>

228
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,757
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Get out of the way!</font>

229
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,647
<font face="Constantia" size="53">BK... 201...</font>

230
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:25,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">How... are you still...</font>

231
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,307
<font face="Constantia" size="53">So that was your own blood...</font>

232
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:38,457
<font face="Constantia" size="53">In an instant... That can't be...</font>

233
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,227
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It looks like I was faster than you.</font>

234
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:47,847
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Hold it!</font>

235
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:21,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Wei Zhi Jun attempted to take 
 complete control of Chen Long Tang,</font>

236
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:28,127
<font face="Constantia" size="53">killing Wang and the executives, as well as the daughter, for good measure.</font>

237
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,147
<font face="Constantia" size="53">He also tried to frame you as the suspect.</font>

238
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:39,247
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Strangely enough, Wei's corpse disappeared from the morgue.</font>

239
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,797
<font face="Constantia" size="53">As I thought.</font>

240
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,447
<font face="Constantia" size="53">His star didn't fall that night.</font>

241
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">The mission is over.</font>

242
00:19:54,317 --> 00:20:01,607
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Do you think I would have been able 
 to save Alice if I didn't join the police?</font>

243
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,887
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Who knows?</font>

244
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,697
<font face="Constantia" size="53">No one can read people's minds or predict the future.</font>

245
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:14,377
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Then again, can you imagine yourself as someone who isn't an officer?</font>

246
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,107
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Kanami... when did you start smoking?</font>

247
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:29,657
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I'm also a weak person who has to 
 depend on something in order to live.</font>

248
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,717
<font face="Constantia" size="53">There are a lot of people who rely on you.</font>

249
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:42,177
<font face="Constantia" size="53">However, you have a bad habit of 
 shouldering the entire burden by yourself.</font>

250
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:48,397
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It'll be a problem if you don't come to my aid when I ask you for help.</font>

251
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,277
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I see.</font>

252
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:59,007
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Would you mind not smoking next to me, though?</font>

253
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,997
<font face="Constantia" size="53">My clothes are going to smell.</font>

254
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,657
<font face="Constantia" size="53">You're going to decline the promotion?</font>

255
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:05,527
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yes.</font>

256
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,837
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Can you tell me why?</font>

257
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:13,237
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I realized my shortcomings during the most recent case.</font>

258
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:15,447
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I cannot go further as of yet.</font>

259
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:22,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I was unable to save someone who only I could have saved.</font>

260
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:28,777
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Do you know the consequences of rejecting an offer like this?</font>

261
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,227
<font face="Constantia" size="53">I stand firm in my decision.</font>

262
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:36,727
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Very well. Inspector Kirihara, you may leave.</font>

263
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,077
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Sir.</font>

264
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,617
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Boss, is something wrong?</font>

265
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:46,827
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Why do you ask?</font>

266
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,897
<font face="Constantia" size="53">It was just a thought.</font>

267
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:50,597
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Don't say things on a whim.</font>

268
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:52,127
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

269
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,867
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Saitou, I'm counting on you.</font>

270
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,427
<font face="Constantia" size="53">Did you say something?</font>

271
